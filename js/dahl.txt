Red Lentil Dahl
Serves 6

Ingredients
1 tablespoon sesame oil or olive oil
1 cup finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 cups vegetable broth
1 cup dried red lentils, rinsed and picked over
1 teaspoon  cumin  
1 teaspoon  coriander
1 teaspoon  turmeric
¼ teaspoon  cardamom
¼ teaspoon  cinnamon
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
vegan yogurt, garnish


Gather the ingredients.
In a 3-quart stockpot or other medium-sized soup pot, heat the sesame oil over medium heat.

Once the oil is hot, add the onion & garlic. Cook, stirring often, until the chopped onion is translucent, about 6 minutes.

Stirring constantly, add the broth, lentils, and spices (but not the salt). 

Bring to a low boil, then turn down the heat to low, cover and let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes, or until lentils are very tender.

Stir in the tomato paste & salt until well combined.

Cook several minutes more, or until the soup is at the desired temperature and consistency, adding more water to the dahl if needed.

Garnish with a dollop of vegan yogurt.
